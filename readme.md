# Awesome SST [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of applications built using the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST).

The Structural Simulation Toolkit ([SST](http://sst-simulator.org/)) was developed to explore innovations in highly concurrent systems where the ISA, microarchitecture, and memory interact with the programming model and communications system.

## Section

About this section. Optional. Keep this short and focus on the list.

- [SimEng](https://uob-hpc.github.io/SimEng/) - The Simulation Engine (SimEng) is a fast, cycle-level, open-source simulation framework under development by the University of Bristol's High Performance Computing group. SimEng targets the design space of modern HPC processors with a current focus on AArch64 (Armv9.2-a) and RISC-V (rv64imafdc) instruction set architectures.
- [Q-adaptive routing](https://github.com/SPEAR-UIC/q-adaptive_sst) - An implementation of Q-adaptive, a multi-agent reinforcement learning based routing algorithm for the Dragonfly network in the SST-elements/merlin.
